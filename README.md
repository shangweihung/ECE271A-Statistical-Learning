Core Problem: Segment the cheetah image into its two classes, **cheetah** and **grass**.  

## Homework 1  
Apply **Bayesian Decision Rule** to predict the class of each pixel.

## Homework 2  
Apply **Gaussian Model** with **MAP Rule** to predict the class of each pixel.

## Homework 3
Implement **Predictive Distribution** to encode distinct prior information strategy into prediction the class of each pixel.
Provide comparison between "predictive distribution solution","MAP solution" and "ML solution".
(Homework 4 is as same as Homework 3)

## Homework 5
Implement **EM Algorithm** with 1) fixed number of components 2)distinct number of components.
