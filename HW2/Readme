Implement MAP Rule with Gaussian conditional probabilities assumption by sliding 8*8 block DCT calculation with index followed zigzag pattern.
* With 64 features (All) Error Rate: 9.35%
* With 8 best features (Pick by visualization) Error Rate: 5.09%

Comment: 
Both results perform better classification mask than using bayes decision rule.
