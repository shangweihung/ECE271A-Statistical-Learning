Implement EM algorithm  

1.  
Generate 5 classifiers for foreground and 5 classifiers for background randomly under fixed number of components.  
Compare these 25 combinations of classifiers and predict each pixel.  
2.  
Generate some classifier with distinct number of components and predict each pixel.
